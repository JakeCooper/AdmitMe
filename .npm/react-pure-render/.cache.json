If you don't want to use stage 0 transforms, you can use a base class instead:\n\n```js\nimport PureComponent from 'react-pure-render/component';\n\nexport default class Button extends PureComponent {\n  render() { }\n}\n```\n\n#### Mixin\n\nIf you're working with `createClass`-style components, use the mixin. It's exactly the same as [`React.addons.PureRenderMixin`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html).\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\nvar PureMixin = require('react-pure-render/mixin');\n\nvar Button = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [PureMixin],\n\n  render: function () { }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = Button;\n```\n\n#### shallowEqual\n\nSometimes `shallowEqual` is all you need. It's bad to reach out into React internals, so this library exposes exactly the same `shallowEqual` you already know and love from React.\n\n```js\nimport shallowEqual from 'react-pure-render/shallowEqual';\nconsole.log(shallowEqual({ x: 42 }, { x: 42 });\n```\n\n### Known Issues\n\nIf a component in the middle of your rendering chain has pure rendering, but some nested component relies on a `context` change up the tree, **the nested component won't learn about `context` change and won't update**. This is a [known React issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2517) that exists because `context` is not a documented feature and is not finished. However some React libraries already rely on `context`, for example, [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). My suggestion for now is to use pure components in apps relying on such libraries very carefully, and only use pure rendering for leaf-ish components that are known *not* to rely on any parent `context`.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n* [PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html)\n* [Advanced Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html)\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gaearon","email":"dan.abramov@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-06-11T18:32:06.760Z","created":"2015-05-04T20:50:07.211Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-04T20:50:07.211Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-04T21:06:58.655Z","1.0.2":"2015-06-11T18:32:06.760Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gaearon/react-pure-render","keywords":["react","pure","render","shouldComponentUpdate","optimization","performance"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gaearon/react-pure-render.git"},"author":{"name":"Dan Abramov","email":"dan.abramov@me.com","url":"http://github.com/gaearon"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gaearon/react-pure-render/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"nelix":true,"devalphac":true,"princetoad":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"2Y7I346GRSNVX1DRG4VZBZW1Y\""}
