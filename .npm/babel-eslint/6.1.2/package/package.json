ESLint actually supports ES6/ES7, JSX, and object rest/spread by default now.\n\n##### At the moment, you'll need it if you use stuff like class properties, decorators, async/await, types.\n\n> If there is an issue, first check if it can be reproduced with the regular parser or with the latest versions of `eslint` and `babel-eslint`!\n\nFor questions and support please visit the [`#linting`](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/linting/) babel slack channel (sign up [here](https://babel-slack.herokuapp.com))!\n\n> Note that the `ecmaFeatures` config property may still be required for ESLint to work properly with features not in ECMAScript 5 by default. Examples are `globalReturn` and `modules`)\n\n## Known Issues\n\nFlow:\n> Check out [eslint-plugin-flow-vars](https://github.com/zertosh/eslint-plugin-flow-vars): An `eslint` plugin that makes flow type annotations global variables and marks declarations as used. Solves the problem of false positives with `no-undef` and `no-unused-vars`.\n- `no-undef` for global flow types: `ReactElement`, `ReactClass` [#130](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/130#issuecomment-111215076)\n  - Workaround: define types as globals in `.eslintrc` or define types and import them `import type ReactElement from './types'`\n- `no-unused-vars/no-undef` with Flow declarations (`declare module A {}`) [#132](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/132#issuecomment-112815926)\n\nModules/strict mode\n- `no-unused-vars: [2, {vars: local}]` [#136](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/136)\n\nPlease check out [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) for React/JSX issues\n- `no-unused-vars` with jsx\n\nPlease check out [eslint-plugin-babel](https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel) for other issues such as (and more):\n- `generator-star` with async/await functions [#78](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/78)\n- `object-shorthand` with spread operator [#131](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/131)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nESLint allows custom parsers. This is great but some of the syntax nodes that Babel supports\naren't supported by ESLint. When using this plugin, ESLint is monkeypatched and your code is\ntransformed into code that ESLint can understand. All location info such as line numbers,\ncolumns is also retained so you can track down errors with ease.\n\nBasically `babel-eslint` exports an [`index.js`](/index.js) that a linter can use.\nIt just needs to export a `parse` method that takes in a string of code and outputs an AST.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install eslint@1.x babel-eslint@5 --save-dev\n\n$ npm install eslint@2.x babel-eslint@6 --save-dev\n```\n\n### Setup\n\n**.eslintrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"strict\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [ESLint docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) for all possible rules.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`sourceType` can be set to `'module'`(default) or `'script'` if your code isn't using ECMAScript modules.\n`allowImportExportEverywhere` can be set to true to allow import and export declarations to appear anywhere a statement is allowed if your build environment supports that. By default, import and export declarations can only appear at a program's top level.\n\n**.eslintrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\n  \"parserOptions\": {\n    \"sourceType\": \"module\",\n    \"allowImportExportEverywhere\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Run\n\n```sh\n$ eslint your-files-here\n```\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/babel/babel-eslint\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/babel/babel-eslint.svg?branch=master\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"babel-eslint@6.1.2","_from":"babel-eslint@6.1.2"}
