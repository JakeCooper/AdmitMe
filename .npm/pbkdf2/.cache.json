derivedKey = pbkd2f.pbkdf2Sync('password', 'salt', 1, 32, 'sha512')\n\n...\n```\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis module is a derivative of https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/pbkdf2-sha256/, so thanks to [JP Richardson](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/pbkdf2-sha256/) for laying the ground work.\n\nThank you to [FangDun Cai](https://github.com/fundon) for donating the package name on npm, if you're looking
