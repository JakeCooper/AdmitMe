Quickly go from prototype to production, building sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Foundation. Includes a fully customizable, responsive grid, a large library of Sass mixins, commonly used JavaScript plugins, and full accessibility support.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe quickest way to get started is with the [basic CSS download](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download/). You can get versions with every component, essential ones only, or a custom build.\n\nIf you're a Sass user, we have two starter project templates, the [Basic Template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template) and the [ZURB Template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template). You can install them by manually downloading them from GitHub, or using the [Foundation CLI](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli).\n\nLastly, if you're rolling your own setup, you can install Foundation through a variety of [package managers](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/installation.html#package-managers).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation can be found at <https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs>. To run the documentation locally on your machine, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed on your computer. (Your Node.js version must be 0.12 or higher.)\n\nRun these commands to set up the documentation:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites\ncd foundation-sites\ngem install scss-lint\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run `npm start` to compile the documentation. When it finishes, a new browser window will open pointing to a BrowserSync server displaying the documentation.\n\n## Testing\n\nFoundation has three kinds of tests: JavaScript, Sass, and visual regression. Refer to our [testing guide](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/wiki/Testing-Guide) for more details.\n\nThese commands will run the various tests:\n\n- `npm run test:sass`\n- `npm run test:javascript`\n- `npm run test:visual`\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out our [contributing guide](http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/contribute.html) to learn how you can contribute to Foundation. You can also browse the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/labels/help%20wanted) tag in our issue tracker to find things to do.\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 ZURB, inc.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"foundation-sites@6.2.3","_from":"foundation-sites@6.2.3"}
