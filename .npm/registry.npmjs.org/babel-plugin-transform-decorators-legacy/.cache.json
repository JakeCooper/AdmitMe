Babel Legacy Decorator plugin\n\nThis is a plugin for Babel 6 that is meant to replicate the old decorator behavior from\nBabel 5 in order to allow people to more easily transition to Babel 6 without needing to\nbe blocked on updates to the decorator proposal or for Babel to re-implement it.\n\n## Why \"legacy\"?\n\nDecorators are still only a relatively new proposal, and they are (at least currently) still\nin flux. Many people have started to use them in their original form, where each decorator\nis essentially a function of the form\n\n    function(target, property, descriptor){}\n\nThis form is very likely to change moving forward, and Babel 6 did not wish to support\nthe older form when it was known that it would change in the future. As such, I created this\nplugin to help people transition to Babel 6 without requiring them to drop their decorators\nor requiring them to wait for the new proposal update and then update all their code.\n\n## Best Effort\n\nThis plugin is a best effort to be compatible with Babel 5's transpiler output, but there\nare a few things that were difficult to reproduce, and a few things that were simply incorrect\nin Babel 5 with respect to the decorators proposal.\n\nTwo main things to mention as differences, though not things you are likely to encounter:\n\n1. Decorators expressions are evaluated top to bottom, and executed bottom to top. e.g.\n\n    ```\n    function dec(id){\n        console.log('evaluated', id);\n        return (target, property, descriptor) => console.log('executed', id);\n    }\n\n    class Example {\n        @dec(1)\n        @dec(2)\n        method(){}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In Babel 5, this would output:\n\n    ```\n    evaluated 2\n    evaluated 1\n    executed 2\n    executed 1\n    ```\n\n    With this plugin, it will result in:\n\n    ```\n    evaluated 1\n    evaluated 2\n    executed 2\n    executed 1\n    ```\n\n    which is what the spec dictates as the correct behavior and was incorrect in Babel 5.\n\n2. Static class property initializers are evaluated once up front.\n\n    If you decorate a static class property, you will get a descriptor with an `initializer` property.\n    However whereas with Babel 5 this could be re-executed multiple times with potentially differing\n    results, `decorators-legacy` will precompute the value and return an initializer that will\n    return that value. e.g.\n\n    ```\n    function dec(target, prop, descriptor){\n        let {initializer} = descriptor;\n        delete descriptor.initializer;\n        delete descriptor.writable;\n\n        descriptor.get = function(){\n            return initializer.call(this);\n        };\n    }\n\n    var i = 0;\n\n    class Example {\n        @dec\n        static prop = i++;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In Babel 5, every access to `prop` would increment `i`.\n    In Babel 6, the very first value of `i` will be cached for future `initializer` calls.\n\n    The spec is a little vague around how initializers work for repeat calls, and I'd consider\n    calling an `initializer` multiple times to be a mistake in general, so hopefully this will\n    not cause anyone trouble.\n\n## License\n\nMIT (c) 2015\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"},{"name":"loganfsmyth","email":"loganfsmyth@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-12-20T04:16:24.526Z","created":"2015-12-02T23:57:32.273Z","0.0.0":"2015-12-02T23:57:32.273Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-03T06:18:37.153Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-03T16:10:15.209Z","1.2.0":"2015-12-08T08:08:02.253Z","1.3.0":"2015-12-13T21:28:08.749Z","1.3.1":"2015-12-14T18:19:47.701Z","1.3.2":"2015-12-17T08:16:48.425Z","1.3.3":"2015-12-17T20:31:13.407Z","1.3.4":"2015-12-20T04:16:24.526Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["babel","babel-plugin","es7","decorators"],"author":{"name":"Logan Smyth","email":"loganfsmyth@gmail.com"},"users":{"imasterale":true,"trikadin":true,"moimikey":true,"juankiz":true,"chocolateboy":true,"shipengyan":true,"ziliwesley":true,"ziflex":true,"ubi":true,"goodnights":true,"abhisekp":true,"migaky":true,"shonny.ua":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"33DBVPESMWLAVVBMH392H4U9H\""}
