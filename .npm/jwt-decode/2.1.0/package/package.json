You should validate the token in your server-side logic by using something like [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt), [koa-jwt](https://github.com/stiang/koa-jwt), [Owin Bearer JWT](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/Auth0-Owin-JwtBearerAuthentication), etc.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with npm, bower, or downloading from the build directory of this repository.\n\nUse with AMD, browserify or just include with an script tag.\n\n## Usage\n\n~~~javascript\nvar token = 'eyJ0eXAiO.../// jwt token';\n\nvar decoded = jwt_decode(token);\nconsole.log(decoded);\n\n/* prints:\n * { foo: \"bar\",\n *   exp: 1393286893,\n *   iat: 1393268893  }\n */\n~~~\n\n**Note:** A falsy token will throw an error.\n\nCan also be used with [browserify] or [webpack] by doing `npm install jwt-decode` and requiring:\n\n~~~javascript\nvar jwtDecode = require('jwt-decode');\n~~~\n\n## Develop\n\nRun `grunt dev` and fire a browser at http://localhost:9999/test_harness.html.\n\n## Issue Reporting\n\nIf you have found a bug or if you have a feature request, please report them at this repository issues section.
